# Quora-Question-Pairs-Similarity
Natural language Processing
Bag of Words and Tfidf vectorizer was used to tokenise the words in a pair of sentences.
We experimented with stopwords removal and lemmatization to see which allows us to identify duplicates better.
Machine learning models adopted are :
XGboost, random forest, LSTM and support vector machine (SVM).
The dataset was taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs .
